Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods as detect and translate.

Compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+. (Note: Python 2 support will be dropped in the next major release.)

For details refer to the API Documentation.
This is a great deal for everyone! (up to 2x times faster in my test) If you want to get googletrans faster you should install hyper package. Googletrans will automatically detect if hyper is installed and if so, it will be used for http networking.
You may wonder why this library works properly, whereas other approaches such like goslate won’t work since Google has updated its translation service recently with a ticket mechanism to prevent a lot of crawler programs.

I eventually figure out a way to generate a ticket by reverse engineering on the obfuscated and minified code used by Google to generate such token, and implemented on the top of Python. However, this could be blocked at any time.
